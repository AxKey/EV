# endless-override-art-files

Peter Cartwright and Ambrosia Software, Inc. have worked together to bring you almost all the original 3D designs used to create the graphics for EV: Override.
	This includes the models for planets, stations, ships, weapons, outfit items, and so on. They are all Infini-D format, because that's what was used to make them.
	If anyone knows how to, and cares to take the time to, convert them to another format (even assuming that's necessary, I'm not familiar with many 3D packages),
	they are free to distribute them in that format, as long as it is distributed as a complete package with this documentation.

 Notes on these files, what's here and what isn't, credits, apologies, explanations, reminiscences and possibly even some useful information. If you read all this, you are a very patient person. 
 
 # IMPORTANT NOTE
 
 This is not an official Ambrosia release! Ambrosia software can make no promises that the files you have just downloaded will not wreck your hard drive and your life along with, and nor can I. Do not contact AmbrosiaSW regarding problems encountered using these files (see below for details - point 7).

 1. What have I just downloaded?
 
2. Exactly what files should I have?

3. What unusual files are in here, and what files that should be here aren't?

4. Who is responsible for the creation of this collection?

5. Who holds copyright, and what am I allowed to do with all this stuff?

6. Okay, but what would I want to use these for, and how would I go about doing so? * 

7. If I have problems using these files, or need some other kind of help with using them, who should I contact? 

\* Note that this section is the longest, and contains the largest proportion of nonsense, irrelevancies, harkings back to the early alpha days - which only three people including myself have any memories of - when half the ships were pink and the rest were still the ones out of EV, and simply useless information. I'd like to say it's worth reading for a few gems of information hidden within - but it isn't really, just glance over it unless you have nothing better to do. 

# 1. What have I just downloaded?

Hopefully you checked this out carefully before you downloaded this file. If you are just an ordinary EVO player, innocent of all knowledge of plug-in and 3D ship design, I regret to inform you that what you have just acquired will be of virtually no use to you whatsoever. 

More likely, however, you know what you're doing and also know that you now have copies of almost all the original 3D designs used to create the graphics for EV: Override. This includes the models for planets, stations, ships, weapons, outfit items, and so on. They are all Infini-D format, because that's what was used to make them. If anyone knows how to, and cares to take the time to, convert them to another format (even assuming that's necessary, I'm not familiar with many 3D packages), they are free to distribute them in that format, as long as it is distributed as a complete package with this documentation (such as it is). 

# 2. Exactly what files should I have?

Along with this ReadME, you should have 6 folders (Ships, Outfits, Weapons, Spobs, Bits & Pieces and Pics2Sprites) and a Template file. The Ships folder contains the designs for all the ships (to keep them in order, these files are all numbered  - add 128 to the number to get the corresponding ship ID# from EVO. Some designs have several numbers, this is because several shâ€¢ps use the same design).

The other folders are not as organised; the Weapons folder holds all the weapons, the Outfits for the outfits (although be aware that some outfit items, eg. 'Rocket' use designs from the weapons folder taken from a different angle and these are not repeated in the Outfits folder). A few outfit items use the original graphics from EV - which are not included here.

The Spobs folder contains three more folders, Moons, Planets and Stations. Moons and Planets, unfortunately, use some arcane code of numbers and letters to identify them, whose secrets I have entirely forgotten (I think D is desert, and I is icy!) Anyway, you probably won't be interested in those anyway, they are just included for completeness.

Pics2Sprites is Matt Burch's application for converting PICS files created by a 3D package to (you guessed it) sprites usable by the EV application. You probably have a copy of this already. It includes its own documentation, which you should certainly read if you haven't used it before - its operations are not intuitive.

The Template file (another Infini-D file) contains only four objects - these are the 3 cameras and 1 light all in the standard positions used by all these models (with a few necessary variations). You may find this useful if you wish, for example, to add in a plug-in ships which look as similar as possible to existing ones.

Finally the Bits & Pieces folder contains several images which are used, or might be used, by various 3D designs (note that when you first open and try to render the designs which use these images, you will be asked to find them - this folder is the place to look). Also the 'green' palette used for the scanner pictures, and the Crillee font which is used for the text in the scanner pictures.

# 3. What unusual files are in here, and what files that should be here aren't?

There's an unused and half-completed design for an alternate version of the UE Cruiser in the Ships folder (16 - UE Cruiser II), as an example of how the old designs might be improved and altered without totally changing the basic concept - it's not especially good itself, but then I never got around to finishing it.

Also in the Ships folder there's a file called Coke Machine. The story behind this one goes something like this: Chris, my graphics designer, had a design for a coke machine he wanted me to use somewhere in my scenario; I explained that there wasn't really any obvious (or useful) place for it to be used - but then had this random idea for a mission involving a mysterious coke machine drifting through space which the player would have to investigate for some bemused aliens. This became the Strange Asteroid mission which you may be aware of. Unfortunately, I got the model for the coke machine, but not the image with 'Coca-Cola' on which was rather vital for the graphic to be useful. So I put in a temporary place-holder graphic, left the mission in, and waited for the image to turn up... I'm still waiting. I think he's lost it himself actually. Anyway, if anyone can put their own coca-cola graphic on the design, and put the whole thing into a plug, I'd be thrilled to see that mission make sense at last (or at least, for it to make as little sense as it was meant to make).

The Shuttle design is missing the weapon on its nose - must have mislaid that somewhere (actually, I was making an unarmed version and forgot to Save As... - and I can't get at my back-ups right now).

Some of the fighter-carrying ship designs include their fighters in the file, at an appropriate scale for use in the shipyard graphic ... and some don't. If I was more organised there'd be two versions of each, one with and one without but then, I'm not.

There are a few outfit items whose original design I could not track down, if I ever had them - these include; Repulsor Beam and Tractor Beam, and Sensor Upgrade.

I don't know of anything else that's missing off-hand - but apologies in advance for whatever is. 

# 4. Who is responsible for the creation of this collection?

The vast majority of these designs were created long before Override became an Ambrosia project, and even before it was called Override, by myself (Peter Cartwright) and Chris West. In general, the respectable-looking ones were done by Chris, and the more primitive, embarassing ones are the responsibility of yours truly. More specifically, in case you need to know:

Spobs - All by PC. 

Outfits - PC except for ECM system, Emalgha weapons and Escape Pod (the latter may have been a joint effort, or I may just have been watching - it was a long time ago).

Ships - All CW except UE Destroyer, Carrier and Cruiser, Voinian Interceptor, Lazira and Cargo Transporter and the modifications made for the various 'variant' designs (except the Zachit Fighter - CW) which are PC. 

Weapons - PC except for Plasma Siphon (FlameThrower).

Almost all of the designs were edited and messed about with by me before finally going into the game, however.

Most of the ships and a few other things were based on drawings by the one and only James Mudd, but we don't give him any credit because he hasn't the slightest idea how to use a computer ; ) (he also helped design a couple of systems and missions - including the Fuzzes and the mad old Voinian on Fu). A useful bloke to have around for some very strange conceptual ship designs - but strictly pencil and paper only.

Pics2Sprites is of course, as already mentioned, entirely the creation of Matt Burch (AFAIK). 

# 5. Who holds copyright, and what am I allowed to do with all this stuff?

I believe that myself, Chris and James hold copyright (since these models are not used directly in EVO, just images taken of them), although I haven't looked into it in detail so it might be AmbrosiaSW. It's not all that important though: either way, what you are allowed to do anything you like with them, as long as you don't make a profit out of designs made using these ones or based on these (all sounds rather hard to prove to me - I shouldn't worry too much).

# 6. Okay, but what would I want to use these for, and how would I go about doing so?

Many scenario designers have expressed a desire to have access to these designs for various reasons. For example: 

- to create a QT movie involving ships from EVO, previously impossible since you would need these 3D models to do a convincing job. 
    
- to add new ships or other items to EVO which would have the same familial relationship to existing EVO ships that they do to one another (eg. the UE warships, Voinian ships, Miranu ships, Crescent ships). This was previously rather difficult to pull off since you would really need (at least) the surfaces used for the original designs. 

- to create an entirely new, improved graphics library for EVO. This was previously at least very difficult since it is hard to work out what a ship concept was and how to make a new 3D design for it with only 2 or 3 perspectives to work from. I'd love to see this done well - EV's graphics were simplistic, EVO's were quirkier, but many were just as simplistic - brilliant ship designs don't make a good scenario, and in fact they are probably one of the least important things (although they certainly need to be passable), but they sure help to make a brilliant one 

Feel free to try anything else you like with these designs as well. I hope you find them useful. 

As for how you go about using them, well I can't help you all that much. If you don't already know how to use a 3D graphics program fairly well, and if you haven't made graphics for EV with one before, you're still going to have to learn how yourself. Neither are the designs themselves especially user friendly, and the labelling of objects is fairly arcane (eg. Thing 1 & Thing 2). A few useful notes (actually most aren't useful at all, just my notes on how design X came to be and what was going on at the time):

- for all designs intended to rotate, the object around which the whole thing rotates is called 'Parent' (or should be, no guarantees) and is a small, invisible sphere somewhere around the centre of the ship/weapon. All other objects which are part of that ship/weapon should be linked to the parent (directly or indirectly). Note that in the case of those ships with solar panels, one of the objects (called l/h bearing or something similar) connected to the panel(s) rotates in the opposite direction to the rest of the ship at the same rate, while still being attached to the rest of the ship (thus staying fixed in one direction - towards the light source - while the rest of the ship turns). A fairly simple little trick, but quite effective - thank you, Chris.

- in the shuttle design: the shuttle's screen (called 'Parent Object', but not actually the object rotated around - that's just 'Parent') has two alternate surfaces - one, Chrome, was used for the comm screen, the other, Glass, for the others. The shuttle model was not originally designed for Override but for a movie being made by Chris (I forget for what purpose), in which it flew out of a hangar (the screen changing surface as the 'sunlight' hit it), flew along a bit and then crashed for no readily apparent reason - already it was clear I had found my graphics designer. Note that in the unfortunate new pilot transition screen, the shuttle and arguably the two corners being its only bright spots, the screen is about halfway between the two surfaces.

- the UE fighter's guns: let me just say I didn't want that design - I wanted something like the Hawk (which I used for the fighter early in alpha - before I knew enough to call it alpha). Once upon a time the guns were even bigger and the hull was pink! This design was, for reasons best known to him, insisted on by Chris. Anyway, I've grown fond of, or at least used to, it, and now it'll actually (thanks to x-offset) be able to fire out of those guns. - what was I going to say? not sure ... well the comm camera's zoomed in to a funny position - no idea why, this isn't the shot used <shrug>
  
- my original concept for the V. Frigate was as a hulking, flat-fronted, multi-irregular-sided block - then Chris gave me my first lesson on what you could do in practical terms with Infini-D. I prefer his frigate anyway, now.
  
- what's now the FE F-C was originally one of Chris' suggestions for the UE Destroyer - which I had great trouble explaining to him how I wanted it to look. Another of his proposals was this flatfish-like blue-yellow marbled thing - a bit like the Miranu ships now. Part of the problem was that I had the temporary graphic (Reb. Destroyer) fixed in my head from flying one in endless, endless, endless testing of UE vs. Voinian combat. All UE missions from Dreadnought till the last few (for which I'll allow the Cruiser) should be done with the Destroyer, outfitted only from human space - and possibly some Emalgha cannon (the rest of the galaxy didn't exist at this time) - at least, that's what it was tested on - repeatedly.
  
- the Dreadnought is, IMHO, still a class piece of work. James and I had given Chris the broadest idea of what we'd like, and what we got back was nothing like what we'd asked for, and exactly what we wanted. It's still awesome to see appear on the screen
  
- the only reason the Interceptor exists is 'cause I wanted to put more fighters on the Dreadnought, but didn't want to arse around with having two different Voinian fighter bays with different outfits and ammo, etc. It's just a stretched version of the fighter, as you can probably tell.
  
- the Krait, Turncoat and Helian were very early designs which were just random ships made by Chris which I found slots for. They're probably some of the nicest designs in there - shame they have such a lousy role in the game.

- UE Cruiser II - well ... I think it's at least an improvement, if a bit fiddly with the funny struts going out to the fins. I didn't finish and use this, because the destroyer and carrier would have had to be re-done to match - and I couldn't figure out what to do with them.

- we didn't know quite what to make of the Miranu courier at first sight. Finally I shrugged and just used it - neither would the player. The Miranu gunship was an extra design made by Chris for a Miranu warship. The Miranu don't make warships, I thought. Half the reason I wrote the Zachit Gunship missions was so as to have a use for this graphic as a bonus ship. Also note that for both Miranu freighters, the shipyard image was taken with the cargo pods removed.

- the Crescent warship (originally Strand warship - text still used in the name of the escort desc) was as I remember the first Crescent design completed and includes an enormous number of little crystals in enormous detail. We liked it, obviously, but Chris despaired every time we asked for 'another ship like that crystally one' as they took forever to do. With the exception of the Igazra, all subsequent Crescent ships were considerably less detailed. 

- the Azdara once had a little movie where it did fun things like flapping its wings to dodge phase fire, taking fire with its shields, and generally swooping around - wonder what happened to that

- ah, the mighty phal- I mean, Igazra. Well it's Chris' design, but I let it in - I'm not quite sure who that damns more, in Freudian terms. Perhaps it's all really a devious Igadzra plot to confuse primitive human minds with their vessels' symbology. 

- I believe the Emalgha ships were originally intended to be the other way round - by this time Chris was sending me 3D designs, not images, and I was setting up the cameras in the right spots doing the scaling, animation (sparing Chris a lot of processor time in the case of many large ships) and the masks and so on. Due to unclear labelling, Chris' intended fighter ended up scaled as the freighter, and the freighter as a teeny little baby fighter. Eventually Chris pointed this out, by I far preferred them the way round fate had left them. 

- the cargo transporter and lazira were additions made in late beta, to add some more variety and fill some gaps between ship classes. I did the designs (as I was completely out of touch with Chris, and he was mostly uninterested by this point). The CT is obviously based on the freighter with all the same surfaces and the solar panels. The Lazira is my poor imitation of the Crescent designs, its inferiority being explained away in the shipyard description as the influence of alien technologies ;)

- the FlameThrower/Plasma Siphon is another example of me going to great lengths on behalf of a random graphic which Chris had come up with and wanted me to find a use for. Still, it gave me a plot for one of the Igadzra strings, and really does help against those Azdaras if used properly.

- the SAE module was a late addition, made to give the Igadzra a better guided weapon as part of the changes made when Matt added the new guidance options. The original colour scheme for the SAD was the red-orange-yellow one, but this went better with the Igadzra colours and so the new green scheme was used for the SAD instead.

- by the time I got round to doing the purs. miss. launcher graphic, I'd got bored with just tubes, so I tried to come up with the silliest launching mechanism I could think of.

- The Crescent station is my attempt to remember a possibly-DS9 influenced drawing James did which was much more complicated and heavily laden with crystals. You'll note that the it has camera positions for a comm view and a (very large) top down view. I won't say anything about that ...

- I hope Chris never reads all this nonsense - I sound really nasty about all his designs - Chris, I don't mean it really! Ah, hell, it's not like you're going to do any more now is it!

- a few notes on using Infini-D for EV purposes in general (I expect you know all this stuff already): spin ships three times at 36 frames per second and make a PICS file of frames 37 to 73 (using the middle, second spin - there may be a more elegant way of avoiding the speed up-slow down problem, but we are simple, blunt folk), making sure Crop to differences is not set. Then put that through Pics2Sprites (multiple of 8x8, remember - and with some of the high numbers, 80+, not all combinations work). Do consider the ship as a whole piece, but also look at it regularly from the actual camera angles you mean to use - these are the only ones the player will ever see.

Similarly, no matter how prettily textured it looks in Infini-D, remember that in EV it'll just be in 256 colours - which can mess things up a lot (like Emalgha wood, often). Similarly again, it's all very well putting loads of details and moving parts onto the design, but they'll be hard to see in the game, and EV only has a few images to play with - unless you plan to put the ship in a movie to show all this off, don't bother except for simple things (like the solar panels, the shuttle's screen, the Azdara's wings and so on) - unless of course, you have time to waste. To do scanner graphics EV style - (<begin short rant> I've never liked plugs where scanner graphics are replaced by ordinary colour images of the ship. It doesn't feel _right_ somehow, it doesn't tell me anything about the ship I don't already know, and it gives the often justified impression that the creator did not make the choice to do them this way, but just couldn't work out how to do 'real' scanner graphics - which really isn't hard <end short rant>) - take a top down view (not camera) of the ship in wire frame (usually wire frame norm. but depending on the complexity and size of the design this may vary), get the image into photoshop or something similar (about 128x64 I think), and mess about with it with the green palette until it looks good. To do them EVO style do the same, but with a front and side view, slightly smaller. For the labels, use Crillee (hurrah for Crillee! which does the strangest things with 'n's you could think of - how many fnis does your ship have?) point 7 I think, or maybe point 9 (again, mess around till it looks the right size). Do make sure you get the right background shade of green, or things will look very wrong.
  
  Anyway, that's enough of that paragraph: there are plenty of people around who are very experienced in this kind of thing, and most of them will be happy to help, and if you managed to find this, you probably know where to find them.
  
  # 7. If I have problems using these files, or need some other kind of help with using them, who should I contact?
  
  The important answer here is _not_ Ambrosia! This is not an entirely official release, and Ambrosia promises no tech. support, and makes absolutely no guarantees that these files will agree with the health of your Mac. All is at your own risk!
  
 However if you do have problems or comments or anything else to say or suggest, feel free to e-mail me at: pacartwr@hotmail.com. Please don't send any designs or graphics you've created without checking with me first that that's okay. If you wish, I may be able to put you in touch with James and Chris, the other designers, but I think they'd prefer it if I didn't give out their e-mail addresses here.
 
 Best of luck to all with their latest EV-related creations,
