If anyone knows how to, and cares to take the time to, convert them to another format 

(even assuming that's necessary, I'm not familiar with many 3D packages),

they are free to distribute them in that format, as long as it is distributed as a complete package with this documentation.

5. Who holds copyright, and what am I allowed to do with all this stuff?

I believe that myself, Chris and James hold copyright

(since these models are not used directly in EVO, just images taken of them), 
 
although I haven't looked into it in detail so it might be AmbrosiaSW.
 
It's not all that important though: either way, what you are allowed to do anything you like with them,
 
as long as you don't make a profit out of designs made using these ones or based on these 
 
(all sounds rather hard to prove to me - I shouldn't worry too much).
